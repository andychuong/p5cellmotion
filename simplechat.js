/*

Plan: sepearate users by their id.

To do this, have a counter. If it is the first thing the user says, the counter will go from 0 to 1.

When the counter goes from 0 to 1 per user:
 - creates a string with the user id, mabye name?
 - appends this string to the users input message. 


 To filter the chats.
 - remove the id phrase from the 'message' string
